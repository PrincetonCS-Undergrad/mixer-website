Several undergraduate organizations (NSBE, SHPE, SWE, PWiCS) are organizing a series of monthly mixers to better facilitate interaction between undergrads and various parts of the Princeton CS community. Each event may have light programming centered around a theme (chosen by the student organizers).

The first one is Friday 2/10/23 from 4:30-5:30 PM in [the Friend Convocation room](https://m.princeton.edu/default/map/index?filter=Friend&_recenter=true&feed=campus_map&id=_T013&parentId=campus_map%2FTransit), the theme is "_You belong here_", and the goal is to chat about journeys to Princeton from various communities. There will also be ice cream and cookies.

Faculty, grad students, and postdocs (and anyone else on this list) are invited to participate if you'd find it fun! (Participate = just show up and chat with undergrads about your/their journeys to Princeton).
