# COS Mixer Website

Several undergraduate organizations (NSBE, SHPE, SWE, PWiCS) are organizing a series of monthly mixers to better facilitate interaction between faculty and students. Each event may have light programming centered around a theme (chosen by the student organizers).

The first one was Friday 2/10/23 from 4:30-5:30 PM in the Friend Convocation room, and the theme is "_You belong here_", and the goal is to chat about journeys to Princeton from various communities. There will also be ice cream and cookies.
